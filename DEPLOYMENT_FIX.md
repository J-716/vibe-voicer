# ðŸš€ Deployment Fix for Origin Issue

## The Problem
Better Auth is rejecting requests from `https://www.j-designs.org` because it's not in the trusted origins list.

## The Solution
I've updated the code to explicitly include your domain in the trusted origins.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Deploy the Code Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Better Auth trusted origins for custom domain"
git push
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Vercel
Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

Add these variables:
```
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://www.j-designs.org
TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://localhost:3000,https://www.j-designs.org,https://j-designs.org
SMTP_FROM=noreply@vibevoicer.com
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here
```

### 3. Redeploy
After setting the environment variables, trigger a new deployment.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Explicit Domain Inclusion**: Added `https://www.j-designs.org` to trusted origins
2. **Environment Variable Support**: Added `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` env var for flexibility
3. **Fallback Logic**: Multiple ways to ensure your domain is trusted

## Verification

After deployment, check:
1. Visit `https://www.j-designs.org/api/health` - should show all services configured
2. Try signing up - should work without 403 errors
3. Check Vercel logs - should not see "Invalid origin" errors

## Expected Result

The trusted origins list should now include:
- `http://localhost:3000`
- `https://localhost:3000` 
- `https://www.j-designs.org` âœ…
- `https://j-designs.org`
- Your Vercel URL

This should resolve the 403 "Invalid origin" errors!
